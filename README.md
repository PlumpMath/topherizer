Topherizer is a Java console application for generating the
`max.java.config.txt` file, which Max's Java users have, for the last
eight years, been painstakingly editing by hand. Topherizer allows the
configuration to be written in Clojure, with a cleaner structure,
conditional "statements" and some shortcut functions.

(It is arguable whether, at first glance, Clojure is an
improvement. Editing Clojure in a conventional text editor is a fiddly
procedure, but there are editors like Emacs (with Sam Aaron's
[emacs-live][el]) which make the procedure much more efficient.)
